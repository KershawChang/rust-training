# Ferrous Systems' Rust Training

This is free workshop material produced by Ferrous Systems for trainings. See our [ferrous-systems.com/training](https://ferrous-systems.com/training) for more details or a custom quote.

The material is created with people with zero Rust experience but with a programming background in mind.

Ferrous Systems offers a large Rust curriculum for both beginner and advanced Rust developers.

Ferrous Systems specialises in custom, topic focused workshops for enterprises starting or expanding their use of Rust. Supplemental to our courses, we offer ongoing help and feedback.

# Overview

The materials are presented as a set of small, self-contained lessons on a specific topic. Note that lessons might be revised, extended, or removed, when necessary to keep material up to date or relevant to new audiences.

We assemble these lessons into various programmes for our commercial trainings. We can also provide custom lessons - please [reach out](https://ferrous-systems.com/contact) if that is of interest.

# Reading the material

This material is organised as an [`mdbook`](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook), which we also render to [`reveal.js`](https://revealjs.com) slides using an open-source tool we wrote called [`mdslides`](https://crates.io/crates/mdslides).

You can:

* Browse [the chapters of the book on Github](./training-slides/src/SUMMARY.md)
* Clone the repo, and build the book using [`mdbook`](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook) or [`mdslides`](https://crates.io/crates/mdslides)
* Download the slides in both slide-deck and book format, from the [releases area](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/rust-exercises/releases)
